# Javascript Koans provided by Carlos Ble

I am learning javascript and I really learn about the language with this exercise. You can find the koans in Carlos ble's Bitbucket's repository: https://bitbucket.org/carlosble/javascript4testers/src/9041f19505196abb588f6407d13b9a11a3e8c6df/learnJavaScript/koans.js?at=default

It is important to do the exercise without speed, trying to understand what tests are saying ;)
